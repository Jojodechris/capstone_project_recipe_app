Here is a breakdown of each file:

---->home.html

This file displays the home page of my website. It contains a list of all the recipe types that you can search for. The list is generated using the recipe_types variable, which is passed to the template from the homepage() function in app.py.

---->app.route('/{{recipe}}')

This route handles requests to the recipe description page. It takes the recipe type as a parameter and uses it to make a request to the FatSecret API. The response from the API is then used to generate a list of recipe descriptions, which is passed to the description.html template.

---->description.html

This file displays the recipe descriptions. It returned the recipe description for the recipe type that was selected by the user.

 iterates over the array of  recipe_descriptions and prints each description to the page.
